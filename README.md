# Statistical-Inference-Course-Project
Course Project for Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization

This repository contains course project files.    

Note: Plots are currently not displayed correctly in the .md files since the project was submitted elsewhere as a pdf (per instructions). I will convert the images to pdfs, but for now the pdf is the best version to view. The appendix includes all code required for analysis/plotting.

The project consists of 2 parts:

1. Simulations from Exponential Distribution
   -- files are named "Exp_Samp_Dist"
   -- primary objective was to explore the Central Limit Theorem using iid variables from an exponential distribution
   
3. Analyzing Tooth Growth
   -- files are named "ToothGrowth"
   -- primary objective was to use statistical inference techniques to analyze the tooth growth data set in R
   -- data came from an experiment analzying the effect of Vitamin C on tooth growth in guinea pigs based on method of delivery and dose level

   The .Rmd files contain raw code. The .md files contain code that can be previewed in a readable format (including charts). The pdfs contain formatted versions of the files.
